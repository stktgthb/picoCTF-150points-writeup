# Extensions

## Description

This is a really weird text file TXT? Can you find the flag?

## Solution

When we opened the file with a text editor, it looked like a 16 digit number. When I put it on the degit converter, it doesn't show any useful info. Since the title is extensions so we have tried to change file extensions. The issue was resolved by changing the extensions from .​​txt to .png
